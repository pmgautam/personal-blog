    "In this post I'll be discussing about Knowledge Distillation. Basically, I'll be summarizing the concept from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) on Knowledge Distillation. Knowledge Distillation is the process of training a smaller network by using the concepts/knowledge that has been learned by the large network. Basically, it is the process of distilling knowledge from one model to another."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "Larger models have high learning capacity and can perform well when trained on large datasets. This is the pattern followed in Machine Learning. If getting the best accuracy is the only aim then this approach is fine. But when we want to deploy the model in hardware with less compute or time constraints (e.g: deploying models on mobile phones), deploying large models is not an option. We want to have smaller models that perform on par or close to large models but be efficient in computation. The main motivation behind Knowledge Distillation is to use large, complex models during training so that they can extract a lot of concepts from the data and use these models to train smaller models that will be used in inference as they are more efficient (computation and memory-wise) than large models."

    "## Analogy\n",
    "An analogy from stages of butterfly's life can be related to the concepts of Knowledge Distillation. They need to eat a lot to gain nutrition and energy. They also need to be light to fly around and mate. Since these are opposite tasks, there are separate forms for such tasks. Caterpillar is the stage that feeds a lot to gain energy and nutrition. Its task is just eating. Once this stage is complete, it is transformed to butterfly for tasks such as flying, mating that require lightweight. The same pattern can be suitable in Machine Learning as discussed in motivation (training a large complicated model and using a small/light model for inference)."

    "## Task\n",
    "The task in Knowledge Distillation is to train a smaller model that performs better than itself trained from scratch. For this, a large model using lots of data to high accuracy will be trained first. This is known as a **teacher**. It is able to learn a lot of concepts with its large size/learning capacity. For inference, a smaller model is trained using the knowledge acquired by the large model. The small model that is used in inference is called **student**."

    "Knowledge is the concept that is acquired by the teacher model, i.e: output of teacher for various images. In the above example, although the model is quite sure that the image is of car, there is something interesting about probabilities of other classes as well. We can see that the model is far more sure about the image being a truck than a carrot. This knowledge is used by Knowledge Distillation to train a smaller model. The model having 0.09 confidence of being a truck and 0.01 confidence of being a carrot is a very useful information. We ignore this knowledge while training a classifier. Knowledge distillation aims to use this knowledge effectively to train the smaller model. It is also called *dark knowledge* as it exists in the model but is not used for downstream task. Knowledge distillation utilizes this knowledge."

    "As seen in the above table, there are three types of targets that denote the class of a given image. Hard targets denote the class to which the image belongs using 1 and the rest of the classes have a value 0. This is also called one-hot encoding. The second row is the example of model outputs without any changes. In the case of multi-class classification, it is the value of softmax that outputs softer distribution than hard targets and all the classes are assigned some probability values. The last row denotes soft targets which are softened by using the temperature parameter in softmax function. As we make the distribution softer and softer, high probabilities will decrease and small probabilities will increase. Making the distribution softer can make the knowledge valuable to student as it can carry the concepts more clearly (in this case the probabilities of each class i.e: model gives the information not just about the image that it is most sure of but regarding other classes as well). In this example, the model can provide information that there are details that are related to truck and carrot (although smaller) which can be a valuable information while teaching the student model.\n",

    "KD is an effective approach of training a small model to do well in inference so that it could run on devices with less compute. It has come very far from the paper we've discussed. However, the main concept remains the same i.e: training one network by using the knowledge of another network."
